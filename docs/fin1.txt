If you think you can stare at a chart, look at some volume metrics and predict the future direction of the market or stock, you've been suckered into the "over-confidence bias" and "self-attribution bias". 
Whatever trick you use, you'll be right about 50% of the time. Google the "random walk" hypothesis to see why you haven't learned any "tricks". 

As for the other answer here, if you think you can get rich using a 5 step, easy to learn trick that can be read in under 5 minutes, then I guess you can pray that the illiteracy rate is quite high in your country.

As the billionaire stock picker extrodinaire Charlie Munger once said "anyone who thinks investing is easy is stupid". 

Crack open a financial statement, start reading until you realize what you don't understand, go and learn it, then use your common sense to estimate a fair worth for a company, then buy it for below that price or don't buy it at all. 

Investing is simple, but very difficult. If you don't dedicate yourself to learn it, you cannot compete with those who study the market and stocks 60 hours a week.

One more thing: stop trading.
