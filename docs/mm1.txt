In a new clip to promote the upcoming Shady XV compilation album, Eminem thinks back to the demo version of “Lose Yourself” — a version which he can barely even recall.

“There was another version of that song that I don’t even remember recording,” he says in the 32-second spot. “I don’t remember where I was at when I recorded it. I don’t remember any of the first verse. I don’t remember.”

“So when he called me one day and told me about it,” Em continues, pointing to someone off camera (possibly his longtime manager, Paul Rosenberg), “I was like, What? He was like, Remember the scratch version of ‘Lose Yourself.’ I’m like, No. Seriously.”

Throughout the video, brief lyrics are interspersed. They’re lyrics we’ve never heard before, but that sound like they capture the same energy and perspective as the version that went on to hit #1 on charts worldwide, sell millions of copies, and win Grammys and an Academy Award.

“If I was froze inside of a moment,” he raps, later adding, “If I could capture time inside a capsule,” and, “Then I’d try to channel it through Cadillacs and Buicks.”
