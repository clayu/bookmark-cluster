 Running for president takes blood, sweat and tears, literally. Especially the sweat.
Recalling his own campaign and debate experiences, Mitt Romney sympathized with Florida gubernatorial candidate Charlie Crist on Tuesday, saying that he knows why the former governor insisted on using a fan during his debate in October.
"You may have read that one of the candidates for governor of Florida this year put a fan under his podium when he debated," Romney said. "I sure know why: debating can be sweaty business."
Speaking to students at his alma mater -- Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah -- on Tuesday, Romney said that debating on a national level is harder than it looks.
"You may find it hard to imagine what it is like to debate an opponent on national TV. I was not a high school debater," Romney said. "In fact, until I got into politics, the only person I had ever debated was my 5-year-old son, Matt. And he usually won."
"My 2012 campaign had 23 televised debates, 20 with fellow Republicans and three with President Obama. These guys were no debate slouches. Newt Gingrich had been Speaker of the House. And President Obama, well, he had been President for four years. He kind of had his facts nailed down by that point."
