Obama graduated from Columbia, and then from Harvard Law (Magna Cum Laude, which means as an "A" student) and was the president of the Law Review.  He went on to be a law professor* in Chicago for 12 years, successfully completed a  senatorial term and is about to finish his second term as the President of the United States.

Palin barely scraped by college, was an abysmal mayor of a small town, and was wrapped up in scandal as the Governor of Alaska before quitting half way through her first and only term.  She has admitted to not understanding basic questions about civics, journalism, history, politics, foreign affairs, and basic science.

Why are we even asking this question?

---- Addendum
* Before I hear one more complaint that "he wasn't a professor", please read the web site of University of Chicago law school.  He was a Senior Lecturer, which is considered a professor position, and was offered numerous times to join the faculty.
