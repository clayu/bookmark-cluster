It would definitely be possible.  In fact, writing a backend for a basic Twitter clone in Node.JS would be relatively trivial.  

But would it be faster?  Well, Twitter was originally written as a Ruby on Rails app.  They later rewrote the entire system in Scala, and it now runs on the JVM.  This resulted in a 100x performance increase (The RoR app was handling 200-300 request per second per host, while the JVM app is handling 10k- 20k requests per second on the same hosts.) 

It is very safe to say that by writing the app in Node, they could easily beat the speed of RoR, which is painfully slow and not great at concurrency.  But I am not at all sure they could beat the speed of the Scala / Java app, which is running very fast.
