Just more than a week after Eminem made headlines for his music video "Shady Cxvpher," in which he raps about punching Lana Del Rey in the face "like Ray Rice," the 42-year-old musician seems to have found a new targetâ€”and it's none other than Iggy Azalea. 
In a leaked snippet from a new track, which is reportedly title "Vegas"  and will be featured on his forthcoming album SHADYXV, the controversial recording artist throws major shade at the "Black Widow" beauty and even threatens rape (the tune is attributed to Bad Meets Evil, a group comprised of Eminem and Royce Da 5'9"). 
"Back to basic / Unless you're Nicki, grab you by the wrist / Let's ski, so what's it gon' be? / Put that s--t away, Iggy," Eminem raps, seemingly praising Nicki Minaj and her curvy bod while slamming Iggy's enviable booty (the video below may have language that's offensive to some).
