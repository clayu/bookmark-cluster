President Obama is definitely smarter by every reasonable inference. However, Palin, despite my disdain for her, knows how to talk to ordinary people and has a roguish charisma. 

A much more interesting question would be is Bill Clinton smarter than Obama. Clinton has incredible charisma and the ability to speak and connect with anyone, a weak point for Obama who often comes across as cerebral, professorial, and disdainful. However Clinton is also a brilliant policy geek, Rhodes Scholar, and I would give him the edge over Obama, plus he has far greater charisma than Palin.

One more question, which I can't possibly answer: Is Hillary smarter than Bill?
